        <p> Number bases are systems by which quantities can be expressed by a set of numerals with values dependent on their position in the number. Base-10 (AKA decimal) is the number base that we use every day and that we all think in. It uses the digits 0 - 9 and the positions have values in increasing powers of 10. <br> Here is an example of how decimal works for the number 4823: <br> ⠀ </p> 

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Position⠀</b></td>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Digit</b></td>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>8</td>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>3</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Value</b></td>
                <td>4000⠀</td>
                <td>800⠀</td>
                <td>20⠀</td>
                <td>3</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p> <br> Each digit has a value equal to its value x 10<sup>position</sup>. This can be generalised to base-n by saying that each digit will have the value of the digit’s value x n<sup>position</sup>. Base-n will have n unique numerals. <br> ⠀ </p>

        <h1 id="binary"> Binary </h1>

        <p> <br> Binary is base-2. It uses 2 numerals, 1 and 0, and the positions have values in increasing powers of 2. If there is a 1 in a certain position in the binary number, then that position’s value is added to the number total, and if there is a 0 it is not. <br> Here is an example for the binary number 11010: <br> ⠀ </p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Position⠀</b></td>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Digit</b></td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Value</b></td>
                <td>16⠀</td>
                <td>8⠀</td>
                <td>0⠀</td>
                <td>2⠀</td>
                <td>0⠀</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p> <br> Therefore the binary number 11010 is 26 in decimal (16 + 8 + 2). <br><br> Though binary is rarely used by people when counting or doing maths, computers use binary to store and process information. This is because binary's two-state system aligns perfectly with the on/off states of electronic switches. It would be very difficult for computers to handle 10 numerals as we do, but 2 numerals is easy. <br><br> Use the calculator below to convert numbers from decimal to binary: </p>

        <form>
            <input type="number" id="binaryNumber" placeholder="Number">

        <p id="binaryOutput"> Input a positive integer. </p>
        <p>⠀</p>

        <h1 id="hexadecimal"> Hexadecimal </h1>
        <p> <br /> Hexadecimal is base-16. It uses 16 numerals, 0 - 9 and A - F (or a - f) where the letters have values continuing from the numbers (ie A = 10 and F = 15). The positions have values in increasing powers of 16. The amount added to the number total for each digit is the numeral’s value x 16<sup>position</sup>. <br> Here is an example for the hexadecimal number 1AE3: <br />⠀ </p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Position</b></td>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Position Value⠀</b></td>
                <td>4096⠀</td>
                <td>256</td>
                <td>16</td>
                <td>1</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Digit</b></td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>A</td>
                <td>E</td>
                <td>3</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Value</b></td>
                <td>4096⠀</td>
                <td>2560⠀</td>
                <td>224⠀</td>
                <td>3</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p> <br> Therefore the hexadecimal number 1AE3 is 6883 in decimal (4096 + 2560 + 224 + 3). <br><br> When converting from decimal to hexadecimal it is often easier to first convert to binary. The binary number can be split into 4-bit (4-digit) segments which can each be replaced by their value’s hexadecimal numeral. <br><br> For example, to convert 3346 into hexadecimal, first convert it to binary - 110100010010. Then split it into 4-bit segments and replace them with the corresponding hexadecimal numerals: <br>⠀</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Segment⠀</b></td>
                <td>1101⠀</td>
                <td>0001⠀</td>
                <td>0010</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Value</b></td>
                <td>13</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Numeral⠀</b></td>
                <td>D</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>2</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p> <br> Therefore 3346 is D12 in hexadecimal. <br><br> Hexadecimal is mainly used as a more compact way to store binary information. As each hexadecimal digit corresponds to 4 binary digits, hexadecimal numbers can be up to 4 times shorter than their binary equivalents. Hexadecimal’s usage of 16 numerals also makes it much more readable, thus hexadecimal is very useful for displaying information that will be read by humans, for example, colour codes. <br><br> Use the calculator below to convert numbers from decimal to hexadecimal:</p>

            <input type="number" id="hexNumber" placeholder="Number">

        <h1 id="other-number-bases"> Other Number Bases </h1>

        <h3> <br> Unary (Base-1) </h3>
        <p> <br> Though rarely thought of as a number system, any sort of simple counting is unary. For example, counting on fingers and tallying are both unary as they use 1 numeral and the value of each position goes up in powers of 1 (all just 1). </p>

        <h3> <br> Octal (Base-8) </h3>
        <p> <br> Octal is very similar to hexadecimal in how easy it is to convert from binary to octal - simply three binary digits represent one octal digit. Therefore, octal has all the same benefits as hexadecimal but its less commonly used as binary is often split into 8-digit segments, so hexadecimal works much better. All bases that are powers of 2 can be used to represent some amounts of binary digits, for example, a base-4 digit would represent 2 binary digits and a base-32 digit would represent 5. </p>
        
        <h3> <br> Duodecimal (Base-12) </h3>
        <p> <br> Duodecimal is sometimes referred to as the dozenal system, due to its usage when counting things in dozens. Some people advocate for duodecimal to be used instead of decimal because 12 has more proper divisors than 10, so it can be easier to work with. </p>

        <h3> <br> Vigesimal (Base-20) </h3>
        <p> <br> Vigesimal is used when counting things in scores, where one score is equal to 20 things. Vigesimal is also used in some other cultures. </p>

        <h3> <br> Sexagesimal (Base-60) </h3>
        <p> <br> Without realising it, many of us use sexagesimal in our daily lives to communicate time and angles. A time measurement such as 3:20:57 (3hrs 20mins 57secs) can be thought of as a sexagesimal number with three digits, where each numeral is a decimal number. Angles are measured in sexagesimal because there are 60 minutes in a degree, 60 seconds in a minute and a full turn is 6 60 degrees (360 degrees). <br> ⠀ </p>
